It\u0026rsquo;s a form of power that could provide us with a nearly unlimited supply of energy while producing minimal waste and emitting no greenhouse gasses. However, even after achieving multiple successful nuclear ignitions, the path to achieving this goal is still complete.\nThe first major challenge is the technical difficulty of creating a fusion reaction. While it has been done and repeated, the conditions and the price point for these ignitions to happen are costly. Since fusion reactions occur when atomic nuclei come together to form a heavier nucleus, releasing vast amounts of energy in the process, this only happens under conditions of extreme heat and pressure, similar to the conditions that are produced on stars. Replicating these conditions on Earth, in a controlled and safe manner, in a way that can be commercialized requires the implementation of new technologies to make it more efficient.\nAnother significant challenge is the issue of materials. The reactor components must be able to withstand extreme temperatures and intense radiation. Finding materials that can endure these conditions for a long time, without degrading or breaking down, is challenging. Ensuring that these reactors keep developing and remain active for a long time, requires diligent effort on the part of scientists and engineers to create systems that can be developed and deployed quickly and safely.\nWhile fusion is much cleaner than fission, it\u0026rsquo;s not completely without waste. Fusion reactions produce some radioactive waste, which needs to be managed and disposed of safely. Although the waste from fusion is less long-lived than that from fission, this still presents a significant challenge, especially considering the long-learned lessons from nuclear reactors and their respective wastes.\nThe cost of building a fusion reactor is high, and it\u0026rsquo;s still an ongoing process to make fusion energy economically competitive with other power sources. Additionally, due to public opinion of nuclear power and the associations that come with it, fusion faces a lot of regulatory scrutiny, which can cause delays and increase costs.\nThe goal is to make fusion energy the main source of power generation to win the race of climate change. However, with these challenges still present it is important to not focus on this one aspect but to widen the range of options that can be provided by other forms of energy. By that, we wonâ€™t depend on the regulation and development of fusion energy to slow down or stop climate change. The promise of a nearly limitless, clean source of power is too great to ignore. However, it is important to have backups as the timeline of when this energy source can be deployed varies and climate change will not wait on us.\n","date":"17 October 2023","permalink":"/posts/fusionenergy/","section":"Posts","summary":"An article detailing how fusion energy developments are shaping how we reimagine a sustainable future.","title":"Fusion Energy as the Future"},{"content":"Companies, universities, and foundations have been tirelessly working towards inventing some semblance of post-quantum security. Recently, Signal, the encrypted messaging application, released an interesting paper on that topic. The paper introduced the \u0026ldquo;PQXDH\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Post-Quantum Extended Diffie-Hellman\u0026rdquo; key agreement protocol.\nThe premise of the protocol is centered around post-quantum resistance, it is still not a quantum-resistant solution. The core issue that quantum computing poses to internet security lies with Shor\u0026rsquo;s algorithm. This algorithm uses quantum bits and is capable of identifying prime factors - a task that is highly complex when using traditional computers and thus used for all internet encryption. Currently, Shor\u0026rsquo;s algorithm requires a quantum computer with at least 1000 qubits to function. As of now, IBM has released a quantum computer with 434 qubits, with the number seeming to follow Moore\u0026rsquo;s Law (exponential growth). This implies that in the very near future, all existing encryption, and by extension, the notion of private data/information, could be permanently eradicated.\nIn anticipation of this, some malicious actors are adopting a strategy known as \u0026ldquo;harvest now, decrypt later\u0026rdquo;. These actors capture large volumes of encrypted data, typically banking details or state secrets, with the intention of decrypting the data once they have access to a 1000-qubit machine. This means that regardless of whatever post-quantum security measure arises in the future, their data is no longer their own.\nSignal, a platform heavily used by individuals who value privacy and encryption, has come up with a countermeasure to these \u0026ldquo;harvest now, decrypt later\u0026rdquo; attacks. Their method involves supplementing the existing encryption algorithms with a peer-to-peer (P2P) temporary private key, which is used to rehash the message. This key is peer-validated and subsequently discarded after the message has been received.\nThis strategy provides a level of protection against quantum attacks for Signal users\u0026rsquo; information starting from now and a method for others to emulate. However, while this works for now, as this new field of computing keeps growing the world will have to completely rethink encryption in order to prepare for everything that is to come.\n","date":"17 October 2023","permalink":"/posts/quantumres/","section":"Posts","summary":"An article detailing how signal\u0026rsquo;s new PQXDH post-quantum security protocol","title":"Signals approach to quantum resistance"},{"content":"Hello world this is my first post after creating this blog.\nThis blog is made using Hugo with the blowfish theme.
